# Network policies restricting agent pod egress.
#
# From the production blueprint (p.8):
#   "Apply NetworkPolicies restricting egress to api.anthropic.com only"
#
# Worker pods can only:
# - Reach api.anthropic.com (HTTPS, port 443)
# - Reach the orchestrator service (callback, port 8000)
# - Perform DNS lookups (UDP/TCP 53)
